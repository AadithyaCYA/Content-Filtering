# Content-Filtering

This is Client-Server based content filtering and Here we have implemented Stateful Packet Filtering.

Stateful PF - Capable of monitoring and detecting states of all traffic on a network to track and defend based on traffic patterns and flows.
Stateless PF - Only focus on individual packets, using preset rules to filter traffic.
