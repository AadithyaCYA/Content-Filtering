# Content-Filtering

This is Client-Server based content filtering and Here we have implemented Stateful Packet Filtering.

Stateful PF - Capable of monitoring and detecting states of all traffic on a network to track and defend based on traffic patterns and flows.
Stateless PF - Only focus on individual packets, using preset rules to filter traffic.

How to RUN :

1) I have used NetBeans IDE.
2) Download all the codes and open it in NetBeans.
3) Now Run ServerWindow.java.
4) You can set rules in server rules option in server window.
5) Log can be seen in log window in server window.
